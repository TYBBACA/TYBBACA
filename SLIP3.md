Certainly, let's solve both questions step-by-step with clear instructions to run them.

Question A: Socket Program for Prime Number Check

Solution:

Here are the Java programs for the server (PrimeServer.java) and client (PrimeClient.java).

1. PrimeServer.java (Server-side)

import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class PrimeServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(5000)) { // Port number 5000
            System.out.println("Server is running and waiting for client...");

            while (true) {
                Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
                System.out.println("Client connected: " + clientSocket);

                try (
                    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true);
                    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
                ) {
                    String inputLine;
                    while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {
                        try {
                            int number = Integer.parseInt(inputLine);
                            boolean isPrime = isPrime(number);
                            out.println(isPrime ? "Prime" : "Not Prime");
                        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                            out.println("Invalid Input. Please send a number.");
                        }
                        break; // Process one number per connection
                    }
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    System.out.println("Exception in handling client: " + e.getMessage());
                } finally {
                    clientSocket.close();
                    System.out.println("Client disconnected: " + clientSocket);
                }
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Could not listen on port 5000: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public static boolean isPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return false;
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}


2. PrimeClient.java (Client-side)

import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PrimeClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String serverAddress = "127.0.0.1"; // Localhost
        int port = 5000;

        try (
            Socket socket = new Socket(serverAddress, port);
            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);
            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)
        ) {
            System.out.println("Connected to server.");

            System.out.print("Enter a number to check for prime: ");
            String number = scanner.nextLine();
            out.println(number);

            String response = in.readLine();
            System.out.println("Server response: " + response);

        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Client Exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

Question B: Bouncing Ball Applet with Random Colors

Solution:

Here is the Java Applet program (BouncingBallApplet.java).

import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.*;
import java.util.Random;

public class BouncingBallApplet extends Applet implements Runnable {
    private int x, y, radius;
    private int dx, dy;
    private Color ballColor;
    private Thread animator;
    private Random random;

    @Override
    public void init() {
        setSize(300, 200); // Set applet size
        x = 50;
        y = 50;
        radius = 20;
        dx = 2;
        dy = 3;
        random = new Random();
        changeColor(); // Initial color
    }

    @Override
    public void start() {
        animator = new Thread(this);
        animator.start();
    }

    @Override
    public void stop() {
        animator = null;
    }

    @Override
    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        g.clearRect(0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight()); // Clear background
        g.setColor(ballColor);
        g.fillOval(x - radius, y - radius, 2 * radius, 2 * radius);
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        Thread currentThread = Thread.currentThread();
        while (currentThread == animator) {
            x += dx;
            y += dy;

            // Bounce off walls
            if (x - radius < 0 || x + radius > getWidth()) {
                dx = -dx;
                changeColor(); // Change color on bounce
            }
            if (y - radius < 0 || y + radius > getHeight()) {
                dy = -dy;
                changeColor(); // Change color on bounce
            }

            repaint(); // Request repaint
            try {
                Thread.sleep(30); // Animation speed (milliseconds)
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    private void changeColor() {
        ballColor = new Color(random.nextInt(256), random.nextInt(256), random.nextInt(256));
    }
}

Okay, let's solve both parts of Question Q.2 step-by-step.

Question A: C# .NET Program for Sum of Two Numbers

Solution:

Here is the C# .NET program (SumNumbers.cs).

using System;

public class SumNumbers
{
    public static int SumOfTwoNumbers(int num1, int num2)
    {
        return num1 + num2;
    }

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Enter the first number:");
        int number1 = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

        Console.WriteLine("Enter the second number:");
        int number2 = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

        int sum = SumOfTwoNumbers(number1, number2);
        Console.WriteLine("The sum of " + number1 + " and " + number2 + " is: " + sum);

        Console.ReadKey(); // To keep the console window open until a key is pressed
    }
}


Steps to Run Question A in Visual Studio Code (or compatible .NET IDE):

Save: Save the code as SumNumbers.cs.

Open VS Code (or .NET IDE): Open Visual Studio Code (or your .NET development environment).

Create a new C# project (if needed):

If you are starting fresh, you might need to create a new project. Open a terminal in VS Code (View > Terminal) and navigate to the directory where you want to save your project.

Run the command: dotnet new console -o SumNumbersApp and then cd SumNumbersApp. This will create a new console application project named "SumNumbersApp" in a folder of the same name. Replace the contents of Program.cs with the code above.

If you just want to run a single .cs file, you can skip project creation and just ensure you have the .NET SDK installed.

Navigate to the file: Make sure the SumNumbers.cs file is open in your editor.

Run the program:

Using the Terminal (if you created a project): In the terminal within VS Code (in the project directory), run the command: dotnet run

Using Code Runner Extension (if you have it installed in VS Code): If you have the Code Runner extension installed in VS Code, you can right-click within the SumNumbers.cs file and select "Run Code".

Input and Output: The program will prompt you to enter the first and second numbers in the console. After you enter both, it will display the sum.

Question B: VB.NET Program for Teacher Table

Solution:

Here is the VB.NET program (TeacherTable.vb).

Module TeacherModule

    Class Teacher
        Public Tid As Integer
        Public TName As String
        Public Subject As String

        Public Sub New(tid As Integer, tname As String, subject As String)
            Me.Tid = tid
            Me.TName = tname
            Me.Subject = subject
        End Sub
    End Class

    Sub Main()
        Dim teachers As New List(Of Teacher)()

        ' Insert records
        teachers.Add(New Teacher(1, "Seeta", "Math"))
        teachers.Add(New Teacher(2, "Geeta", "Science"))
        teachers.Add(New Teacher(3, "Rita", "English"))
        teachers.Add(New Teacher(4, "Mita", "History"))
        teachers.Add(New Teacher(5, "Nita", "Computer"))


        ' Search for teacher named "Seeta"
        Dim searchName As String = "Seeta"
        Dim foundTeacher As Teacher = teachers.Find(Function(t) t.TName.Equals(searchName, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))

        If foundTeacher IsNot Nothing Then
            Console.WriteLine("Teacher found:")
            Console.WriteLine("Tid: " & foundTeacher.Tid)
            Console.WriteLine("TName: " & foundTeacher.TName)
            Console.WriteLine("Subject: " & foundTeacher.Subject)
        Else
            Console.WriteLine("Teacher named '" & searchName & "' not found.")
        End If

        Console.ReadKey() ' To keep the console window open
    End Sub

End Module

Vbnet
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Steps to Run Question B in Visual Studio Code (or compatible .NET IDE):

Save: Save the code as TeacherTable.vb.

Open VS Code (or .NET IDE): Open Visual Studio Code (or your .NET development environment).

Create a new VB.NET project (if needed):

Similar to C#, if starting fresh, create a new project. Open a terminal in VS Code (View > Terminal) and navigate to your desired project directory.

Run the command: dotnet new console -lang VB -o TeacherTableApp and then cd TeacherTableApp. This creates a VB.NET console app project named "TeacherTableApp". Replace the contents of Module1.vb with the code above.

If you just want to run a single .vb file, you can skip project creation if you have the .NET SDK.

Navigate to the file: Ensure TeacherTable.vb is open in your editor.

Run the program:

Using the Terminal (if you created a project): In the terminal within VS Code (in the project directory), run: dotnet run

Using Code Runner Extension (if installed): Right-click in TeacherTable.vb and select "Run Code" if you have Code Runner.

Output: The program will output the details of the teacher named "Seeta" if found, or a "not found" message in the console.

Important Notes for VS Code and .NET:

.NET SDK: Ensure you have the .NET SDK (Software Development Kit) installed on your system. You can download it from the official .NET website.

VS Code Extensions: For a better .NET development experience in VS Code, consider installing the official C# and VB.NET extensions from Microsoft from the VS Code Marketplace. These extensions provide features like IntelliSense, debugging, and project management.

Visual Studio 2010: While the prompt mentions VS 2010, using VS Code or a more recent .NET environment is generally recommended for modern development and ease of use. If you specifically need to use VS 2010, the code will also work in that environment, but the steps to create and run projects would be slightly different (using the VS 2010 IDE menus instead of command-line or VS Code features).

These are short and clear solutions with steps to run them in VS Code or a compatible .NET IDE. Let me know if you have any more questions.
